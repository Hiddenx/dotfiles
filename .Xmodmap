! Swap caps lock and F10
! lasts for duration of X session
! KDE on CentOS will call this for you
! (called by /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc-common)
! manual usage: xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
!
! This does not work on Centos7 GNOME 3 because
! particularly after suspend / resume, because
! it seems that GNOME blats any xmodmap modifications
! with whatever is configured in xkb.
