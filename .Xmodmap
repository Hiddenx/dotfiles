! Swap caps lock and F10
! lasts for duration of X session
! KDE on CentOS will call this for you
! (called by /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc-common)
! manual usage: xmodmap ~/.Xmodmap
!
! This does not work on Centos7 GNOME 3
! particularly after suspend / resume, because
! it seems that GNOME blats any xmodmap modifications
! with whatever is configured in xkb.
! So, I make changes to xkb keycode files instead.
!
! Sadly with lightdm and Xmonad, .Xmodmap is being read
! as well, which reverses the xkb changes !!!
! So, I'm commenting this out for now.
!remove Lock = Caps_Lock
!keysym F10 = Caps_Lock
!keysym Caps_Lock = F10
!add Lock = Caps_Lock
